{"name":"Prezi-with-leap-motion","tagline":"Use your Prezi with Leap Motion","body":"Use your Prezi with Leap Motion controller\r\n==========================================\r\n\r\nIf you own a Leap Motion controller with this piece of code you can navigate through your Prezi with left/right swipe gestures.\r\n\r\nYou can switch to any prezi you want by changing the preziId url parameter to the desired prezi's id.\r\n\r\n[Check out the demo here!](http://rawgithub.com/kutpet/PreziWithLeapMotion/master/index.html?preziId=7txrmkstwsze).\r\n\r\nIf you have a url of a prezi then the characterset after the prezi.com/ and before the title of the presentation is the id. \r\n\r\nFor example in the url http://prezi.com/7txrmkstwsze/free-fall-template/ the id is 7txrmkstwsze.\r\n\r\nThis is not a full featured client, but a prototype (proof of concept) developed just for fun.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n========\r\n\r\nThe client uses [prezi-player javascript API](http://prezi.github.io/prezi-player/lib/PreziPlayer/) for loading and controlling prezi and [leap.js](http://js.leapmotion.com/) to connect to Leap Motion controller. \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
